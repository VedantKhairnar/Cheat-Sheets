# Word embeddings (=word vectors)

Visualizing word vectors using PCA. Paper: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf
![word-embs](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/linear-relationships.png)

- Word embeddings are vector representation of words. 
- Example sentence: word embeddings are words converted into numbers.
- A word in this sentence may be “Embeddings” or “numbers ” etc.
- A dictionary may be the list of all unique words in the sentence, eg [‘Word’,’Embeddings’,’are’,’Converted’,’into’,’numbers’]
- A vector representation of a word may be a one-hot encoded vector where 1 stands for the position where the word exists and 0 everywhere else. 

### Example

- numbers = [0,0,0,0,0,1] 
- converted = [0,0,0,1,0,0]

** Either use pre-trained word vectors or train our own** 

#### Pre-trained word embeddings:
- Word2Vec (Google, 2013), uses Skip Gram and CBOW
- [Vectors trained on Google News (1.5GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit) - vocabulary of 3 million words trained on around 100 billion words from the google news dataset
- GloVe (Stanford)
- [Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml)
- [LexPredict: pre-trained word embedding models for legal or regulatory text](https://github.com/LexPredict/lexpredict-lexnlp)
- [LexNLP legal models](https://github.com/LexPredict/lexpredict-legal-dictionary) - US GAAP, finaical common terms, US federal regulators, common law

#### Create word vectors yourself

```python
import gensim
word2vev_model = gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec(sentence_list)
```

https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/word-embeddings-count-word2veec/

## How to create word vectors?
- Count-based methods compute the statistics of how often some word co-occurs with its neighbor words in a large text corpus, and then map these count-statistics down to a small, dense vector for each word. 
- Predictive models directly try to predict a word from its neighbors in terms of learned small, dense embedding vectors (considered parameters of the model).
  - Example: Word2vec (Google)

### 1. Count based word embeddings

#### Count Vector (= Document Term Matrix)

![img](https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/04164920/count-vector.png)

#### TF-IDF

Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency

- Term frequency equals the number of times a word appears in a document divided by the total number of words in the document. 
- Inverse document frequency calculates the weight of rare words in all documents in the corpus, with rare words having a high IDF score, and words that are present in all documents in a corpus having IDF close to zero.

(sklearn) in Python has a function TfidfVectorizer() that will compute the TF-IDF values for you


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Write a function for cleaning strings and returning an array of ngrams
def ngrams_analyzer(string):
    string = re.sub(r'[,-./]', r'', string)
    ngrams = zip(*[string[i:] for i in range(5)])  # N-Gram length is 5
    return [''.join(ngram) for ngram in ngrams]

# Construct your vectorizer for building the TF-IDF matrix
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer=ngrams_analyzer)

# Credits: https://towardsdatascience.com/group-thousands-of-similar-spreadsheet-text-cells-in-seconds-2493b3ce6d8d
```

#### Co-Occurrence Vector


### 2. Prediction based word embeddings

- Uses Neural Networks
- CBOW predicts target words (e.g. 'mat') from source context words ('the cat sits on the')
- Skip-gram does the inverse and predicts source context-words from the target words

#### CBOW (Continuous Bag of words)

<img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/softmax-nplm.png" width="400">

#### Skip Gram

Skip – gram follows the same topology as of CBOW. It just flips CBOW’s architecture on its head. The aim of skip-gram is to predict the context given a word

<img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/nce-nplm.png" width="400">

#### Outcome

## Bag of Words


```python
# John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.
BoW1 = {"John":1,"likes":2,"to":1,"watch":1,"movies":2,"Mary":1,"too":1};
```

# spacy


```python
import spacy
```


```python
# Import dataset
nlp = spacy.load("en")
# Import large dataset. Needs to be downloaded first.
# nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")
```

# Stop Words

Stop words are the very common words like ‘if’, ‘but’, ‘we’, ‘he’, ‘she’, and ‘they’.
We can usually remove these words without changing the semantics of a text and doing so often (but not always) improves the performance of a model.


```python
# spacy: Removing stop words
spacy_stopwords = spacy.lang.en.stop_words.STOP_WORDS

print('spacy: Number of stop words: %d' % len(spacy_stopwords))
```

    spacy: Number of stop words: 326



```python
# nltk: Removing stop words 
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
english_stop_words = stopwords.words('english')

print('ntlk: Number of stop words: %d' % len(english_stop_words))
```

    ntlk: Number of stop words: 179



```python
text = 'Larry Page founded Google in early 1990.'
doc = nlp(text)
tokens = [token.text for token in doc if not token.is_stop]
print('Original text: %s' % (text))
print()
print(tokens)
```

    Original text: Larry Page founded Google in early 1990.
    
    ['Larry', 'Page', 'founded', 'Google', 'early', '1990', '.']


# Spans
Part of a given text. So doc[2:4] is a span starting at token 2, up to – but not including! – token 4.

Docs: https://spacy.io/api/span


```python
doc = nlp("Larry Page founded Google in early 1990.")
span = doc[2:4]
span.text
```




    'founded Google'




```python
[(spans) for spans in doc]
```




    [Larry, Page, founded, Google, in, early, 1990, .]



# Token and Tokenization

Segmenting text into words, punctuation etc.
- Sentence tokenization
- Word tokenization

Docs: https://spacy.io/api/token


```python
doc = nlp("Larry Page founded Google in early 1990.")
[token.text for token in doc]
```




    ['Larry', 'Page', 'founded', 'Google', 'in', 'early', '1990', '.']




```python
# Load OpenAI GPT-2 using PyTorch Transformers
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')
# https://huggingface.co/pytorch-transformers/serialization.html
```

# Chunks and Chunking

Segments and labels multi-token sequences.

- Each of these larger boxes is called a chunk. 
- Like tokenization, which omits whitespace, chunking usually selects a subset of the tokens. 
- The pieces produced by a chunker do not overlap in the source text.

# Chinks and Chinking

Chink is a sequence of tokens that is not included in a chunk.

Credits: https://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html

# Part-of-speech (POS) Tagging

Assigning word types to tokens like verb or noun.

POS tagging should be done straight after tokenization and before any words are removed so that sentence structure is preserved and it is more obvious what part of speech the word belongs to.




```python
text = "Asian shares skidded on Tuesday after a rout in tech stocks put Wall Street to the sword"
doc = nlp(text)
[(x.orth_, x.pos_, spacy.explain(x.pos_)) for x in [token for token in doc]]
```




    [('Asian', 'ADJ', 'adjective'),

## BILUO tagging

- BEGIN - The first token of a multi-token entity.
- IN - An inner token of a multi-token entity.
- LAST - The final token of a multi-token entity.
- UNIT - A single-token entity.
- OUT - A non-entity token.


```python
[(token, token.ent_iob_, token.ent_type_) for token in doc]
```




    [(Asian, 'B', 'NORP'),
     (shares, 'O', ''),
     (skidded, 'O', ''),
     (on, 'O', ''),
     (Tuesday, 'B', 'DATE'),

     (Street, 'O', ''),
     (to, 'O', ''),
     (the, 'O', ''),
     (sword, 'O', '')]



# Stemming

Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root form.

Examples:
- cats, catlike, catty → cat
- fishing, fished, fisher → fish

There are two types of stemmers in NLTK: [Porter Stemmer](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/) and [Snowball stemmers](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/)

[Credits](https://stackabuse.com/python-for-nlp-tokenization-stemming-and-lemmatization-with-spacy-library/)


```python
import nltk
from nltk.stem.porter import *

stemmer = PorterStemmer()
tokens = ['compute', 'computer', 'computed', 'computing']
for token in tokens:
    print(token + ' --> ' + stemmer.stem(token))
```

    compute --> comput
    computer --> comput
    computed --> comput
    computing --> comput


# Lemmatization

Assigning the base form of word, for example: 
- "was" → "be"
- "rats" → "rat"


```python
doc = nlp("Was Google founded in early 1990?")
[(x.orth_, x.lemma_) for x in [token for token in doc]]
```




    [('Was', 'be'),
     ('Google', 'Google'),
     ('founded', 'found'),
     ('in', 'in'),
     ('early', 'early'),
     ('1990', '1990'),
     ('?', '?')]



# Sentence Detection

Finding and segmenting individual sentences.


```python
doc = nlp("Larry Page founded Google in early 1990. Sergey Brin joined.")
[sent.text for sent in doc.sents]
```




    ['Larry Page founded Google in early 1990.', 'Sergey Brin joined.']



# Dependency Parsing	

Assigning syntactic dependency labels, describing the relations between individual tokens, like subject or object.


```python
doc = nlp("We are reading a text.")
# Dependency labels
[(x.orth_, x.dep_, spacy.explain(x.dep_)) for x in [token for token in doc]]
```




    [('We', 'nsubj', 'nominal subject'),
     ('are', 'aux', 'auxiliary'),
     ('reading', 'ROOT', None),
     ('a', 'det', 'determiner'),
     ('text', 'dobj', 'direct object'),
     ('.', 'punct', 'punctuation')]




```python
# Syntactic head token (governor)
[token.head.text for token in doc]
```




    ['reading', 'reading', 'reading', 'text', 'reading', 'reading']



# Base noun phrases



```python
doc = nlp("I have a red car")
[chunk.text for chunk in doc.noun_chunks]
```




    ['I', 'a red car']



# Named Entity Recognition (NER)

# Text Classification

Two types:
- binary classification (text only belongs to one class)
- multi-class classification (text can belong to multiple classes)

Assigning categories or labels to a whole document, or parts of a document.

Approach:
- calculate document vectors for each document
- use kNN to calculate clusters based on document vectors
- each cluster represents a class of documents that are similar to each other

    considering the wind and the rain was a respectable showing. \
    Thursday’s first round at the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational \
    was another story. With temperatures in the mid-80s and hardly any \
    wind, the Spaniard was 13 strokes better in a flawless round. \
    Thanks to his best putting performance on the PGA Tour, Rahm \
    finished with an 8-under 62 for a three-stroke lead, which \
    was even more impressive considering he’d never played the \

## CountVectorizer 
- Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts
- [skikitLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html)

# Similarity
How similar are two documents, sentences, token or spans?

Cosine similarity (also known as: L2-normalized dot product of vectors) is a formula used to calculate how similar two given word vectors are.

How to calculate Cosine similarity?
- spacy (see example below)
- scikit: [sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html#sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity)

## Cosine Similarity

Figure below shows three word vectors and Cosine distance (=similarity) between 
- "I hate cats" and "I love dogs" (result: not very similar)
- "I love dogs" and "I love, love, love, .. dogs" (result: similar)

## L2 Norm

Length of a word vector. Also known as **Euclidean norm**.

Example:
- length of "I like cats" is 4.7


```python
doc1 = nlp("I like cats")
doc2 = nlp("I like dogs")
# Compare 2 documents
doc1.similarity(doc2)
```




    0.957709143352323




```python
# "cats" vs "dogs"
doc1[2].similarity(doc2[2])
```




    0.83117634




```python
# "I" vs "like dogs"
doc1[0].similarity(doc2[1:3])
```




    0.46475163




```python
doc = nlp("I like cats")
# L2 norm of "I like cats"
doc.vector_norm
```




    4.706799587675896




```python
# L2 norm of "cats"
doc[2].vector_norm
```




    6.933004




```python
# Vector representation of "cats"

# Sentiment Analysis

Is text fact or opinion? Only perform sentiment analysis on opinion, not facts.

Sentiments:
- positive
- neutral
- negative

2 ways:
- rule-based uses lexicon with polarity score per word. Count positive and negative words. Doesn't provide training data.
- automatic using machine learning (=classification problem). Needs training data.

Sentiment analysis can be performed with ntlk's `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`

# Logistic Regression

A classification model that uses a sigmoid function to convert a linear model's raw prediction () into a value between 0 and 1. You can interpret the value between 0 and 1 in either of the following two ways:

- As a probability that the example belongs to the positive class in a binary classification problem.
- As a value to be compared against a classification threshold. If the value is equal to or above the classification threshold, the system classifies the example as the positive class. Conversely, if the value is below the given threshold, the system classifies the example as the negative class.

# Loss functions

A measure of how far a model's predictions are from its label.

In contrast to:
- reward function

## SSE (sum of squared of the errors)

## Mean Squared Errors (MSE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common loss function used for regression problems.

Mean squared error of an estimator measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.

Can be used for regression problems (say, to predict the price of a house).

Alternatives:
- Binary Crossentropy Loss (is better for dealing with probabilities)

## Binary Crossentropy Loss

Used in binary classification tasks, ie model outputs a probability (a single-unit layer with a sigmoid activation), we'll use the binary_crossentropy loss function.

## Cross-entropy loss

## Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Used in image classification task

## Log loss

Used in logistic regression tasks

# Optimizer

This is how the model is updated based on the data it sees and its loss function.

## Gradient Descent

Optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## Adam

## AdaBoost

## AdaGrad

# NN Frameworks
- Keras (best learning tool for beginners)
- PyTorch (dynamic)
- Tensorflow (declerative programming, can run on Apache Spark)

# Classification

- Binary
- Not binary

# Activation function

A function (for example, ReLU or sigmoid) that takes in the weighted sum of all of the inputs from the previous layer and then generates and passes an output value (typically nonlinear) to the next layer.

https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#activation_function

## Softmax Function

A function that provides probabilities for each possible class in a multi-class classification model. The probabilities add up to exactly 1.0. For example, softmax might determine that the probability of a particular image being a dog at 0.9, a cat at 0.08, and a horse at 0.02.

Example: last layer is a 10-node softmax layer—this returns an array of 10 probability scores that sum to 1.


## Sigmoid

A function that maps logistic or multinomial regression output (log odds) to probabilities, returning a value between 0 and 1

Sigmoid function converts /sigma into a probability between 0 and 1.

## ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)

- If input is negative or zero, output is 0.
- If input is positive, output is equal to input.

# Performance measure

## Accuracy

Used when taining a neural network.

- training loss decreases with each epoch
- training accuracy increases with each epoch

## Precision

TP/(TP+FP)

- TP=true positive
- FP=false positive

## Recall

TP/(TP+FN)

## F1 score

(2 × Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

## Mean Absolute Error

A common regression metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Mean Squared Error



# Early stopping

Early stopping is a useful technique to prevent overfitting.

# Regularization

## L1 Regularization
penalizes weights in proportion to the sum of the absolute values of the weights

https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#L1_regularization

## L2 Regularization

penalizes weights in proportion to the sum of the squares of the weights

# Sparsity

The number of elements set to zero (or null) in a vector or matrix divided by the total number of entries in that vector or matrix.

# Ranking

## Wilson-Score Interval

Used by Reddit to rank comments.

## Euclidean Ranking

## Cosine Ranking

# XLNet + BERT in spacy

# Latent Dirichlet Allocation

# Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a table where each cell `[i,j]` indicates how often label `j` was predicted when the correct label was `i`.

# Naive Bayes Classifiers

- Every feature gets a say in determining which label should be assigned to a given input value. 
- To choose a label for an input value, the naive Bayes classifier begins by calculating the prior probability of each label, which is determined by checking frequency of each label in the training set.
